    <p>Why cry over dried flowers?
        They’re meant to be straw.
        Why cry over miniature roses?
        They’re meant to be small.
         
        Why cry over Buddha’s hand citron?
        Why cry over the hidden flower?
        Why cry over Mother’s burnt forehead?
        Her votive deathglow, her finest hour.
        </p>
    <p>Looking into my daughter’s eyes I read   
        Beneath the innocence of morning flesh   
        Concealed, hintings of death she does not heed.
        Coldest of winds have blown this hair, and mesh
        Of seaweed snarled these miniatures of hands;
        The night’s slow poison, tolerant and bland,
        Has moved...</p>
    <p>You are the start of the week
        or the end of it, and according
        to The Beatles you creep in
        like a nun. You're the second
        full day the kids have been
        away with their father, the second
        full day of an empty house.
        Sunday, I've missed...</p>
        <p>Before man came to blow it right
            The wind once blew itself untaught,
       And did its loudest day and night
            In any rough place where it caught.
        
       Man came to tell it what was wrong:
            It hadn’t found the place to blow;
       It blew too hard—the aim was song.
            And listen—how it ought to go!
        
       He took a little in his mouth,
            And held it long enough for north
       To be converted into south,
            And then by measure blew it forth.
        
       By measure. It was word and note,
            The wind the wind had meant to be—
       A little through the lips and throat.
            The aim was song—the wind could see.
